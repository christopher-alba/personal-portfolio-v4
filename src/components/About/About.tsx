            From a young age I’ve enjoyed design and problem solving. Fast
            forward to the present, and I’m applying my creativity in software
            development or engineering.{" "}
            <Emphasise>
              My career path is currently in web development, and I have a
              preference towards frontend development.
            </Emphasise>
            This is due to my appreciation for the user experience. However, the
            backend also allows me to use my creativity to come up with
            solutions. Therefore,{" "}
            <Emphasise>
              I am also interested in backend or fullstack roles.

            In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games and watching movies. I
            use to play a bit of Minecraft, and built many designs from modern
            houses, to skyscrapers. I even have a YouTube channel called
            Valkraft which showcases timelapses of some of my Minecraft builds.
            Other games I play include: League of Legends, Overwatch 2, Lost
            Ark. Some Movies I’m interested in: Star Wars, Marvel Cinematic
            Universe
